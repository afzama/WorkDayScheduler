# User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively

# Description
This repository contains HTML, CSS and Javascript code to develop a daily planner. This daily planner allows a user to add their upcoming events and tasks for the workday.

# Code Details
To make each hour accessible a customized description ID has been added to each hour therefore any user inputted and save events and tasks are saved into local storage on the page. To see the magic of storing user data into local storage open the Dev tools, locate application, and under local storage you will find the user inputted data next to the corresponding description field.
In addition, based on current time all passed working hours will show in gray color. All current working hours will be red, and all future working hours will be green.
